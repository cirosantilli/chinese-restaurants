## Introduction

My girlfriend is a Chinese foodie, and she showed me what *real* Chinese food is. Here go the best.

Paris has one of the largest Chinese communities outside of China, and there must be around 10~20 restaurants which serve food unlike anything you have ever eaten.

## How to find good restaurants

- talk to Chinese foodies
- Chinese foodie websites
- sinophile foodie websites (like this)

Sites like Google reviews and TripAdvisor are useless for this and will recommend you places in which non-Chinese like to eat at.

If you go out on the street by yourself, you are very unlikely to find really good Chinese food.

If there are only Chinese people inside the restaurant, it is a good indicator that it might be good.

-   **Traiteurs** are simpler restaurants that let you see pre-made foods in a glass showcase for you to choose how big your portions will be.

    They are the best way to eat a cheap and balanced meal in Paris, but I have never found one that serves exceptional Chinese food.

-   **"Asian"** restaurants which mix either of Chinese / Japanese / Vietnamese / Thai are very rarely very good.

    Conversely, restaurants that specialize in a single region of China are more likely to be good (bot not certainly good).

    It is already difficult to do the cuisine for one part of China well, imagine for multiple countries.

    Just beware of "Sichuan" restaurants: their cuisine is so well known even in the West that I've seen many not so good restaurants that describe themselves like that, even if the owners are from another region. But there are many good ones which really are from there as well.

Beware of restaurant *owner changes*: if the menu looks a bit different, it has likely happened.

## How to order

For all restaurants, ask the waiter for suggestions. Tell him that you:

-   want the most typical dishes, **not** what the French eat, but what the **Chinese** eat

-   can eat spicy food, way more than any French person can.

    The term is either "zhong1 la2" (medium spicy) for most restaurants, and "wei4 la4" (little spicy) for very spicy places.

    If you can't eat spicy, either learn or stop reading now and accept the fact that you will never eat good Chinese food.

-   if the restaurant is from some region, ask for dishes from the region, and which are different from other regions.

    I was once given [jiaozi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiaozi) (super popular dish everywhere in China which I buy frozen and eat every 3 days) in a Tibetan restaurant... Yes, I do believe Tibetans also eat jiaozi! :-)

-   Speaking a little Chinese goes a long way towards convincing the owners that you can handle the real thing.

Only order dishes with meat. Those without are not worth the money / time. Aubergine is the exception.

    Like style of chairs and cutlery.

    Ironically, the service was not particularly fast as the name indicates. Normal, but not ultra fast as I imagined :-)

    lotus with rice (Nuo mi tang ou) and boeuf sechee (guo xian sheng ...) not very good, but baked fish and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meigan_cai kaorou were great.

-   Tien Hiang (天香)

    14, rue Bichat, 75010 Paris

    Vegetarian food: most dishes are an imitation of a dish with meat.

    Not as good as the original meat for me, but very interesting and good for a change.

    Chinese vegetarians are rare. In theory, the origin of the food in this restaurant is Hong Kong Buddhism (Buddhist monks cannot eat meat, while other believers can.)

-   Chuanxiangyuan Restaurante (川香园餐馆 )

    R. Barão de Iguape, 47 - Liberdade, São Paulo - SP

    Eat the big fish dishes, they are worth it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuqi_feipian was not very good.

    Free tea was good.

    Rice could be better.

    Owners are actually from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianjin , not Sichuan, as implied by the 川 in the name of the restaurant. GF told me that those big fish dishes are typical from there.
